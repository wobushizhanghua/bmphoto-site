## Theme Setup
## Executive Plugin Requirements

Jetpack by WordPress.com is the only plugin required to make the most of Executive. You can download Jetpack through your WordPress Dashboard Plugins and search for Jetpack and install. You can also download Jetpack here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/

Executive supports the Portfolio content type from Jetpack. Once this portfolio content type is activated, you can start publishing portfolio content. To display the content, you'll need to create a page called 'Work' and under 'Page Attributes' choose the portfolio page template.

## Setting up the Homepage

Create a new page called 'Home'. Under the 'Page Attributes' module, select the 'Front Page' page template and publish. Next create a page called 'Blog' and publish. From here, go to Settings Reading and choose your Front page and Posts page and click the update button when done.

Next: Go to Appearance > Customize > Executive options. This section lets you select your featured pages for your homepage template. Be sure to Save and Publish once you have updated the customizer.
